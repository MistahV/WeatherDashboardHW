# Application Name: City Weather Dashboard


## Description

Welcome to the City Weather Dashboard! Engaging in any sort of activity usually requires planning, and the best planning will ALWAYS take the weather into account. This dashboard will allow any user to quickly search weather conditions by city in order to find the information they need!

This application works in conjunction with the[OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities. Simply type in the name of the city, and the application will show important weather data (weather conditions, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV Index) - both for that exact moment as well as a five day forecast.
